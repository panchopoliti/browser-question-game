## Initial Motivation
Quizzes are incredible. I love to play them. After work with some colleagues, we were always doing questions each other about different topics. So when I started to learn Node.js, I programmed my first Node spanish football quiz [game](https://github.com/panchopoliti/questionGame). Later, I decided to take that same logic to the browser.
